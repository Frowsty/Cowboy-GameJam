# Cowboy-GameJam

Quick little game we made in 48 hours during the Cowboy Gamejam on Itch.io

If you want to compile and play the game make sure you copy the sprite folder to wherever the EXE is located :)

After some improvements to the version that was published for the game jam participation we've now discontinued further development

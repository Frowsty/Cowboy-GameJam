# Cowboy-GameJam

Quick little game we made in 48 hours during the Cowboy Gamejam on Itch.io

If you want to compile and play the game make sure you copy the sprite folder to wherever the EXE is located :)

(The game will continually be worked on until we're pleased with performance and how the mechanics work)
